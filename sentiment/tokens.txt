this

the

Barbara

great

the
the
movie
has
always
seemed
very
t
##rite
to
me
.
the
movie
makes
working
class
people
look
low
and
cheap
.
the
fact
that
the
daughter
is
ashamed
of
her
mother
and
that
the
daughter
does
not
rise
above
it
has
always
made
me
a

uneasy

the

This

a

The
story
is
wrong
and
a
complete
lie

There
is
nothing
in
this
movie
that
accurately
portrays

it
am
##az

I
rarely

these

I
felt

spare

the
pain
I
endured
in

It
'
s
so
stupid
and
imp
##laus
##ible
both
in
the
overall
story
and
in
the
details
that
you
simply
can
'
t
su
##sp
##end
disbelief
.
The
problem
starts
early
,
when
you
see
a
government
researcher
tool
##ing
around
in
a
new
Porsche
and
dining
with
his
team
in
a
rest
##ara

looks

I
just
watched
this
movie
on
Star
##z
.
Let
me
go
through
a
few
things
i
thought
could
have
been
improved
;
the
acting
,
writing
,
directing
,
special
effects
,
camera
crew
,
sound
,
and
lighting
.
It
also
seemed
as
though
the
writers
had
no
idea
anything
that
had
to
do
with
the
movie
.
Apparently
back
in
2007
,
when
the
dollar
was
stronger
you
could
buy
a
super
advanced
steal
##th
bomber
that
could
go
completely
invisible
for
$
75
million
.
Now
-
a
-
days
those
things
cost
about
$
3
billion
and
they
can
##t
go
invisible
.
Apparently
you
can
fly
from
the
US
to
the
middle
east
in
an
hour

I
absolutely
hate
it
when
a

completely
falls
apart
near

after
you
'

already
invested
an
hour
into
it

and
that
'
s
what
happened
with
this
film
.
i
was
intrigued
by
its
actors
and
the
fact
that
ma
##lam

wrote
its
source
story
.
I
haven
'
t
gone
to
read
that
story
but
I
cannot
imagine
that
it
ends
like
this
film
ends
.
Fortunately
i
didn
'
t
pay
good
money
to
see
or
rent
it
because
my

had

oh

This
film
has
got
several
key
flaws
.
The
first
and
most
significant
of
which
is
the
clear
lack
of
a
good
plot
!
This
sadly
makes
the
film
not
only
difficult
to
watch
but
also
sends
the
watch
##er
certain
feelings
of
hopeless
##ness
,
as
if
he
or
she
is
wasting
valuable
time
of
their
short
life
.
This
means
that
the
film
cannot
cap
##ti
##vate
it
'
s
audience
,
instead
it
encourages
the
viewing
public
to
grow
contempt
for
the
film
and
everything
associated
with
it

In

it
really
is

It

they
couldn

just
have

be
silent

still

they

The
makers
of
this
film
have
created
a
future
where
not
only
is
abortion
and
birth
control
illegal
in
every
state
,
but
women
are
prosecuted
for
murder
and
sent
away
to
serve
long
prison
sentences
.
In
other
words
,
this
film
is
every
liberal
##s
worst
nightmare
!
The
political
agenda
is
so
heavy
-
handed
here
and
the
style
of
the
film
is
so
low
-
key
that
it
just
loses
steam
pretty
quickly
.
Regardless
of
which
side
of
the
fence
you
'
re
on
,
I
'
d
recommend
skip

it

Just
don

But
it
grows
boring
and
terribly
predictable
after
the
interesting
start
.
In
the
middle
of
the
film
you
have
a
little
social
drama
and
all
tension
is
lost
because
it
slow
##s
down
the
speed
.
Towards
the
end
the
it
gets
better
but
not
really
great
.
I
think
the
director
took
this
movie
just
too
serious
.
In
such
a
kind
of
a
movie
even
if
u
don
'
t
care
about
the
plot
at
least
you
want
some
nice

i
have
never

only
good
part
about

Drew

I
don

point

The
only
reason
to
give
this
movie
even
a
single
star
is
how
much
the
ending
made
me
laugh

I
had
high
hopes
as
I
usually
love
bad

but
this
just
didn

qualify

It
'

really
just
a
bad
attempt
at
showing
a
character
slide
slowly
into
insanity
,
which
again
,
isn

a
bad
plot
,
but
is
done
poorly
here

There
are
some
scenes
(
such
as
the
ending
)
which
are
not
intended
to
be
funny
,
but
actually
made
me
laugh
out
loud
.
There
were
a
couple
of
times
when
I
thought
the
movie
would
actually
go
in

After
watching
a
dozen
episodes
,
I
decided
to
give
up
on
this
show
since
it
depicts
in
an
un
##real

manner
what
is
mathematical
modeling
.
In
the
episodes
that
Charlie
would
predict
the
future
behavior

individuals
using
mathematical
models
,
I
thought
that
my
profession
was
being
joked
about
.
I
am
not
a
mathematician
,
instead
a
chemical
engineer

but
I
do
work
a

with

So
I
will
try
to
explain
to
the
lay

why
what
is
shown
is
close
to

The

follow

they
have
left
out
too
many
key

Bill
Pa
##xton
stars
in
and
directs
this
highly
original
film
.
Having
watched
the
first
time
I
was
by
how
good
it
was
.
The
reviews
I
had
heard
were
OK
.
As
a
result
I
was
expecting
an
average
thriller
at
most
.
However
because
of
Pa
##xton
##s
excellent
directing
and
acting
the
film
is
well
worth
watching
,
especially
if
you
are
a
horror
film
fan
##atic
.
The
film
is
also
helped
by
the
plot
twists
which
keep
coming
until
the
closing
credits
.
The
films
strongest
point
is
the
storyline
which
I
have
to
say
is
highly
original
and
is
like
I
have
ever
seen
before
.
Well
done
also
to
the
2
young
leads
which
perfectly
convey
the
emotions
[SEP]

The
movie
never
claims
to
be
something
spectacular
like
many
films
do
.
The
films
prop
##s
itself
as
a
fun
and
entertaining
time
.
And
that
'
s
exactly
what
it
was
.
It
is
the
Korean
version
of
a
male
Bring
It
On
.

From
the
get
go
you
can
feel
for
the
rest
of
the
film
and
how
it
will
end
but
the
enjoyment
is
not
in
the
surprise
twists
nor
is
it
the
way
the
film
is
a
carbon
copy
of
another
.
Instead
,
the
enjoyment
is
held
in
the
journey
of
how
the

remaining

to

Grace
is
a

good
movie
with
it
'

in
the
right

Grace
is
recently
widowed
and
realizes
her
late

left
her
with
a
lot
of
debts
.
She
could
lose
her
lovely
house
and
sees
no
other
solution
to
her
misery
than
to
start
growing
marijuana

She
'

living
in

most

would
love
to
live
and
the
villagers
are
all
wonderful
people
most

would

to
have
as

There
'

with

that
is
the

it

the

I

makes
it

is
the

the

the

the

In
my
line
of
work
,
I
occasionally
get
contacted
by
independent
filmmakers
who
are
trying
to
public
##ize
their
film
.
When
I
can
,
I
take
a
look
at
these
low
-
budget
films
and
often
they
make
me
think
that
the
future
of
Hollywood
is
going
to
the
dogs
.
Once
in
a
while
,
though
,
there
is
a
film
that
is
born
of
pure
passion
and
desire
,
as
if
created
for
the
purpose
of
reminding
the
film
industry
that
good
movies
are
still
possible

watch

there

to
all

places

night

either

and
it

Very
good
drama
although
it
appeared
to
have
a
few
blank
areas
leaving
the
viewers
to
fill
in
the
action
for
themselves
.
I
can
imagine
life
being
this
way
for
someone
who
can
neither
read

This

simply
smacked
of
the

On
first
watching
this
film
it
is
hard
to
know
quite
what
has
happened
,
but
on
a
subsequent
viewing
it
become
more
clear
.
I
enjoyed
this
movie
.
Dean
Cain
was
excellent
in
the
role
of
Bob
.
Lex

Do

'
s
character
was
confusing
to
understand
,
at
first
,
she
was
out
to
trap
Bob
but
i
really
believe
she
landed
up
loving
him
although
by
then
she
had
broken
his
heart
.
Dean
Cain
'
s
performance
was
an
usual
excellent
.
He
gets
better
with
every
film
he
does
.
My
only
question
at
the
end
of
the
film
was
what
happened
to
Bob
,
Cam

and
the
baby
.

This

it

,
like

if
your

this
is
for

But
only
if
you
have
a
passion

Being
that

my
favorite
director

,
this
is
quite
fascinating
,
especially
if
you
know
the
style
of
Sc
##orse
##se
'
s
works

Because
then
you
can
understand
where
he
got
his
inspiration
for
many
of
his
films

Not
the
best
