The
Fulton
County
Grand
Jury
said
Friday
an
investigation
of
Atlanta
'
s
recent
primary
election
produced
`
`
no
evidence
'
'
that
any
irregular
##ities
took
place
.

The

further
said
in

##ments
that
the
City
Executive
Committee
,
which
had
over
-
all
charge
of
the
election
,
`
`
deserves
the
praise
and
thanks
of
the
City
of
Atlanta
'

for
the
manner
in
which
the
election
was
conducted
.

The

to
investigate
reports

in
the
hard

fought
primary
which
was
won
by

[SEP]

[CLS]
`
`
Only
a
relative
handful
of
such
reports
was
received
'
'
,
the
jury
said
,
`
`
considering
the
widespread
interest
in
the
election
,
the
number
of
voters
and
the
size
of
this
city
'
'
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
The
jury
said
it
did
find
that
many
of
Georgia
'
s
registration
and
election
laws
`
`
are
out
##mo
##ded
or
inadequate
and
often
ambiguous
'
'
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
It
recommended
that
Fulton
legislators
act
`
`
to
have
these
laws
studied
and
revised
to
the
end
of
modern
##izing
and
improving
them
'
'
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
The
grand
jury
commented
on
a
number
of
other
topics
,
among
them
the
Atlanta
and
Fulton
County
purchasing
departments
which
it
said
`
`
are
well
operated
and
follow
generally
accepted
practices
which
in
##ure
to
the
best
interest
of
both
governments
'
'
.

Me

proposed
[SEP]

[CLS]
However
,
the
jury
said
it
believes
`
`
these
two
offices
should
be
combined
to
achieve
greater
efficiency
and
reduce
the
cost
of
administration
'
'
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
The
City
P
##ur
##cha
##sing
Department
,
the
jury
said
,
`
`
is
lacking
in
experienced
c
##lerical
personnel
as
a
result
of
city
personnel
policies
'
'
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
It
urged
that
the
city
`
`
take
steps
to
remedy
'
'
this
problem
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
I
##mple
##mentation
of
Georgia
'
s
automobile
title
law
was
also
recommended
by
the
outgoing
jury
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
It
urged
that
the
next
Legislature
`
`
provide
enabling
funds
and
re
-
set
the
effective
date
so
that
an
orderly
implementation
of
the
law
may
be

[CLS]
The
grand
jury
took
a
s
##wi
##pe
at
the
State
Welfare
Department
'
s
handling
of
federal
funds
granted
for
child
welfare
services
in
foster
homes

`
`
This
is
one
of
the
major
items
in
the
Fulton
County
general
assistance
program
'
'
,
the
jury
said
,
but
the
State
Welfare
Department
`
`
has
seen
fit
to
distribute
these
funds
through
the
welfare
departments
of
all
the
counties
in
the
state
with
the
exception
of
Fulton
County
,
which
receives
none
of
this
money
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
The
j
##uro
##rs
said
they
realize
`
`
a
proportion
##ate
distribution
of
these
funds
might
di
##sable
this
program
in
our
less
populous
counties
'
'
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
Nevertheless
,
`
`
we
feel
that
in
the
future
Fulton
County
should
receive
some
portion
of
these
available
funds
'
'
,
the
j
##uro
##rs
said
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
`
`
F

to
do
this
will
continue
to

'

on

The
jury
also
commented
on
the
Fulton
ordinary

court
which
has
been
under

for
its
practices
in
the
appointment
of

the

[SEP]

[CLS]
The
jury
said
it
found
the
court
`
`
has
incorporated
into
its
operating
procedures
the
recommendations
'
'
of
two
previous
grand
j
##uries
,
the
Atlanta
Bar
Association
and
an
interim
citizens
committee
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
`
`
These
actions
should
serve
to
protect
in
fact
and
in
effect
the
court
'

wards
from
und
##ue
costs
and
its
appointed
and
elected

from

the

[CLS]
Regarding
Atlanta
'

new
multi

,
the

recommended
`

that
when

management
takes
charge
Jan

the
airport
be
operated
in
a
manner
that
will
eliminate
political
influences
'
'
.
[SEP]

[CLS]
The
jury
did
not
elaborate
,
but
it
added
that
`
`
there
should
be
periodic
surveillance
of
the
pricing
practices
of
the
concession
##aire
##s
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
prices
reasonable
'
